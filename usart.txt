The non addressed devices may be placed in mute mode by means of the muting function.
In mute mode:
• None of the reception status bits can be set.
• All the receive interrupts are inhibited.
• The RWU bit in USART_CR1 register is set to 1. RWU can be controlled automatically
by hardware or written by the software under certain conditions.

The USART can enter or exit from mute mode using one of two methods, depending on the
WAKE bit in the USART_CR1 register:
• Idle Line detection if the WAKE bit is reset,
• Address Mark detection if the WAKE bit is set.


Address mark detection (WAKE=1)
In this mode, bytes are recognized as addresses if their MSB is a ‘1 else they are
considered as data. In an address byte, the address of the targeted receiver is put on the 4
LSB. This 4-bit word is compared by the receiver with its own address which is programmed
in the ADD bits in the USART_CR2 register.



buffer with flag, index

Index	Read Flag	Action (buffer)
0.	FALSE		interrupt can increase index, put buffer.
			state machine can't touch including Read Flag.

1-2. 	FALSE		interrupt can increase index, put buffer.
			state machine will set TRUE.

	TRUE		state machine extract data, reset index, set FALSE.
			interrupt can't touch all




state machine for USART1 (master)
(note: one MSB bit to differentiate address or data)
1. read button
	out: (to USART 2)
	U2 address		= 1 0010 0001
	read button command	= 0 0000 0001

	in:
	buttonState 		= 0 0000 000X


2. control LED
	out: (to USART 3)
	U3 address		= 1 0010 0010
	RGB data		= 0 0000 0XXX (based on buttonState)

3. got 2 usart, receive from master, communicate with PC (Usart 6 to PC)
	out: (to USART 6)
	U6 address		= 1 0010 0011
	RGB data		= 0 0000 0XXX
	buttonState 		= 0 0000 000X





-sm(event,terminalData)

can be NO_EVENT in eventID
